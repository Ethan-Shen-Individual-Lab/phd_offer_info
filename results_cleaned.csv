I applied to the MS program and got into the PhD program instead because MS is self fund, no GRE. I have only a bachelors degree with shitty GPA, but my maths are all excellent, no GRE, no official publications. But I have one publication in review, one submitted and about three in preparation. None of them is in the field I applied to. Each of these projects are in different fields, from humanities to biology. I have been  in touch with PI for a long time, interviewed in December and was asked to apply. I was accepted because I had a lot of practical experiences in the research field of the PI.
I have accepted this offer and I am not waiting for the other programs.

While I assure you that the materials you submitted were carefully reviewed by the faculty in the Department of Near Eastern Studies, I regret to inform you the department did not recommend your admission for the upcoming academic year.

The number of admission offers available at Princeton for entering graduate students is extremely limited, and we cannot offer admission to all applicants who are well qualified. Indeed, many departments have applicants who could be admitted if it were possible to accommodate additional students. Our decisions take into account not only the applicants' merits but also the suitability of the programs to the candidates' expressed interests. Our goal is to achieve a sound match between the strengths of our programs and the interests of the relatively small number of outstanding students that can be accommodated.

Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications which we receive, it is not possible for the department or the Graduate School to go back and review applications to justify the denial or offer advice on fortifying a future application.

I wish you success in your plans for graduate study and thank you for considering Princeton University.",https://www.thegradcafe.com/result/922663
